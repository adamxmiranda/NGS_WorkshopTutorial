# NGS Workshop Tutorial

A Resource for the Guo Lab and future NGS analysis

## Types of NGS Sequencing

There are multiple types of NGS assay that each reveal different information. Understanding each assay you wish to analyze is important for choosing the appropriate pipeline of analysis

* RNA-seq
  * for evaluation of gene transcript levels in a cell population
* ATAC-seq
  * for evaluation of accessible chromatin regions
* ChIP-seq
  * Evaluation of the presence and location of DNA bound proteins
* HiC
  * Evaluation of chromatin-chromatin interactions through proximity ligation
